VPC Network (network)
	- Manage Networking for your resources 
		- VPC nw is global resources
		- VPC nw are logically isolated.
		- All CE, GKE clusters, App Engine Flex instances rely on VPC as backbone.
	- Global Autoscaling and Loadbalancing
	- Highly Available Global DNS NW
	- Interconnect
	- CDN


Components and concepts : VPC
Firewall Rules
	- Control which packets are allowed to travel to which destinations.
	- Default Firewall
		- Block incoming traffic
		- Allow outgoing traffic
Routes
	- How to send traffic from an instance to another.
	- Destination can be inside networqk or outside GCP.
Forwarding rules
	- IP, Port and Protocol
	- Rules from outside GCP to network
	- Rules from network to outside GCP
	- Rules for destinations within GCP
IP Addresses
	- IP
	- Alias IP : if multiple services are running in VM. Give each its alias IP.
VPC Sharing and peering
	- Shared VPC
		- Share a VPC among multiple projects
	- VPC Network peering
		- Allows you to create SaaS platform.
		- Use private RFC1918 IP addresses.
Hybrid cloud
 	- VPN
 	- Interconnect
Loadbalancing
 	- Global external loadbalancing
 		- HTTP(S)
 		- TCP
 		- SSL Proxy
 	- Regional external network lb
 	- Regional internal lb
Private Google Access


VPC NETWORKS

Projects can have multiple networks.
Network Types
	- Default: 
		- All new projects have default network
		- Default networks has subnets in all region
	- Auto:
	- Custom:
Specs for VPC networks:
 	- VPC nw are Global resources, not tied to region or zone.
 	- Subnets are regional resources. (IP Range).
 	- Firewall rules control traffic to and from network.
 	- Resources within VPC can communicate using internal IP.
 	- Instances witing VPC can communicate with Google APIs and services.
 	- IAM used to secure access.
 	- Create Shared VPC for multiple projects to communicate.
 	- VPC Network peering: To connect 2 VPCs in different projects and organizations.
 	- For Hybrid environment : Cloud VPN or Cloud Interconnect.
 	- Support only IPv4 unicast.
 Network and subnets
 	- for creating any resource you need to select VPC and Subnet. For any thing except instance template you also select zone and region.
 	- Networks can have one or more subnets
 	- Subnets are regional scoped.
 	- VPC Types
 		- Auto mode networks : 
 			- Create subnets in all regions (17)
 			- 10.128.0.0/9 CIDR range
 			- difficult to connect 2 automode VPC as they have same subnet ranges by default.
 		- Custom mode network : 
 			- Start with 0 subnets
 		- You can switch Auto mode to Custom mode but cannot revert back
 	- Each subnet should have an IP range
 	- Minimum CIDR /29
 	- Subnet in same VPC network should have unique IP ranges
 	- When u connect 2 VPC, their subnets should have unique IP ranges.
 	- When u connect a VPC to on premise, subnets should have unique Ip ranges.
 	- Subnets can have upto 5 secondary IP ranges (Alias ranges)
 	- You can expand the IP range of a subnet. You cannot shrink it.
Routes and Firewall rules
	- Routes
		- Define paths for packets leaving instances (egress)
		- Types
			- System generated
				- Default route: Allows all egress traffic for VM
				- Subnet route: Defines path to reach all VMs in the subnet via internal IP
			- Custom routes
	- Dynamic routing mode
		- Utilized when connection dynamically via Coud Router, Interconnect or Partner interconnect.
		- Reginal dynamic routing 
			- default
			- Cloud Router learns the routes to on premise nw and applies them to subnets in same region.
		- global dynamic routing
			- Cloud Routes learns and applies the routes to on premise nw to entire VPC
	- Firewall rules
		- Apply to both egress and ingress
		- Implies firewall rules
			- Deny all Ingress
			- Allow all egress

Rules for connecting from within VPC to Internet
	- Need a default internet gateway in the VPC (0.0.0.0/0)
	- Firewall rules must allow egress traffic from Instances
	- One of the following should be true
		- Instance has a external IP
		- Another instance in network serves as NAT

Specs for setting up VPC
	- You can create up to five networks per project. You can request more.
    - The default VPC network counts against the quota, but you can delete it and create a different VPC network if you desire.
    - There are restrictions on naming VPC networks and subnets:
       	- Each VPC network name must be unique within the project.
        - A subnet can have the same name as its parent VPC network.
        - There can be only one subnet of a given name in a region, regardless of parent VPC network.
        - A VPC network cannot have the same name as a subnet in another VPC network. Example: A VPC network named "alpha" can have one subnet per region that is also called "alpha," and a VPC network called "beta" can have one subnet per region called "beta." But, VPC network "alpha" cannot have a subnet called "beta," because there is a network with that name.
