		- Cloud storage 
			- Access : All below can be used togethe as well
				- IAM
				- ACL for more fine grained control
				- signed URL : for time bound access
				- Signed policy document

			- storage class
				- multi_regional 99.95%
				- regional :99.9%
					- cheaper the multi because no egress charge to copy for redundancy
					- integrated with dataproc, ML and BigQuery
				- nearline: 99%
				- coldline: 99%
			- infinitely scalable
			- fully manages
			- eventually consistant
				- revoking access
			- Strong consistency
				- read-after-write
				- read-after-metadata-update
				- read-after-delete
				- bucket listing
				- object listing
				- Ganting access to resources
			- cannot nest buckets. Can nest directories
			- 1 ops per 2 seconds on bucket create and delete
			- storage class of bucket can be changed after creating
			- bucket name , location can be changed by recreating bucket
			- objects
				- 5 TB max
				- object data and object metadata
				- immutable eg cannot append to a file. You can only update the whole file
				- on update permissions are preserved
				- Single object can be updated once per second 503
				- inherits storage class of bucket
			- versioning
				- bucket : enable or disable versioning
				- once versioning enabled, creates archives version of current and updates/deletes existing
				- restore old version or delete permanently
			- u can view some metadata and update other metadata
			- object name should be unique within bucket

	- VM Types
		- high memory
		- high CPU
		- Memory optimized
		- Standard
		- Shared core
	- VM Images and Disks
		- Predefined VM
			- Max 16 disks per VM. 
			- Max 64 TB per disk.
			- Max 10 disks per CPU
		- Custom VM
			- 1 or even number of vCPU
			- RAM > 0.9 - 6.5 GB per vCPU
			- RAM must be multiple of 256 MB
	- Persistance disk
		- Zonal Resource
		- Bootable Snapshots
		- SSD or Magnetic
	- Local Disk
		- Ephemeral : Data stays on restart but not on Delete or Terminate
		- Provides High IOPS basd on size of the disk
		- Fixed size 375 GB
		- Max 8 Loacl disk per VM (3TB)
		- No Live Migration
	- RAM Disk
		- Ephemeral
		- Can be used similar to RAM
		- Alllows data to be persisted in tmpfs. Data lost after restart
	- Boot Disk
		- Persistant disk
		- Bootable
		- Snapshot
	- Moving the Compute Engine to another Zone
		- Through GCP Console
		- Using gcloud commandline
	- Preemptible
		- 80% discount
		- No SLA
		- Charged only if running for 10 minutes or more
		- Only available for 24 hours
		- 30 secs preemption for VM 
	- Pricing Innovation
		- Preemptable : 80 %
		- Sustained Usage:
			- Inferred Usage discount
		- Comitted usage discount
		- Recommendation Engine : Monthyl usage 
IMAGES
	- Private : User
		- Import a bootdisk
		- Create an image
		- Copy one to another image
	- Public : google
	- Community supported : By community

INSTANCE TEMPLATE
	- Definition of machine type
		- image, zone etc
	- Does not setup VM right away
	- Used by Instance Groups
	- Clobal Resource

INSTANCE GROUPS
	- Group of VM
	- Managed
		- Zonal and Regional
		- identical
		- used for auto scaling
		- rolling updates can be done
		- Changes to instance reflects to all VMs in the group
	- Unmanaged
		- unindentical
		- No rolling updates, loadbalancing, auto scaling
	- Used with auto scaling and loadbalancing

		- VM Migration
		- VM and Disk stats
		- Cloud CDN Caching

Live Migration
	- Transparent maintenance
	- Local SSD goes away
	- Preemptable machines not supported
	- check metadata to see if machine is being live migrated
